"""Per-role model roster: which model plays which part.

    scripts/models.py ensure          # write harness/models.json if missing
    scripts/models.py ensure --again  # re-prompt even when it exists
    scripts/models.py get <role>      # print one role's model id
    scripts/models.py budget <role>   # print one role's packet budget in tokens

harness/models.json maps roles to models. It is machine-local and gitignored:
it names models this machine happens to have, which no commit should carry.
Missing on first run, `ensure` detects backends (opencode's configured
providers, `ollama list`, `claude` on PATH), prompts once per role, and writes
the file. Each distinct pick is probed first with a trivial run: a candidate
that can't run here — a bad id, a hosted model whose region isn't enabled —
fails at prompt time with opencode's own error, and the pick is retried;
picking it again keeps it on trust. Present,
the roster stays silent — including when there is no terminal, where prompting
would hang a hook or a gate.

Roles cover more than reviewers: the librarian audits monthly, and future
implement/summarize roles resolve through this same file.

A role's packet budget is its explicit "context" (tokens), else the limit
opencode's cached models.dev catalog lists for the model, else a heuristic
from the model id — Claude-pattern ids read as 200000, anything else as 8192.
The 8192 is deliberately conservative: a local server's allocation is
unknowable from here (ollama defaults to 4-8k unless OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH
says otherwise), and refusing early beats handing a reviewer a packet it can
only read part of. A wrong budget is fixed by writing the real one into the
roster; `budget` never prompts, so review.sh can call it from hooks and gates.

A role may also name a "variant" — the provider's reasoning effort (minimal,
low, medium, high, xhigh, max; which exist depends on the model, and
opencode's models.dev cache lists them). It reaches opencode through agent.py
as `-m provider/model#variant` — the only path; no generated file carries one.
Absent, the model's own default applies. The ensure probe doesn't cover it:
it sends a bare -m, so a variant problem surfaces at runtime, not at prompt
time.
